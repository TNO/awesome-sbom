Now the content of an SBOM is clear, the next question is: how can I use it in my organisation? To eventually be able to use SBOMs for vulnerability management, a number of processes mut be settled.

*Figure 2* provides a diagrammatic overview of the use of SBOMs for vulnerability management within an organisation and the various steps that must be taken. This chapter describes these steps in brief, and the details are further elaborated in the next two chapters

## SBOM processes
Precisely which processes need to be equipped to implement SBOM depends heavily on the organisation-specific context. Nevertheless, broadly speaking, all organisations will have to organise the same two processes:
- **Obtaining the necessary information**, which includes the production, management and eventual resharing of SBOMs.
- **The deployment of the information obtained**, which within the context of this guide is limited to the deployment of SBOMs for vulnerability management.

SBOMs can be obtained in two ways:
- The SBOM is provided by the software supplier. This may either be a commercial software supplier or an open-source community.
- The SBOM must be generated by the organisation itself. This is necessary for software developed in-house, or for software for which no SBOM is (currently) available such as legacy software or open-source code. For software currently under development, this process will often be carried out by development teams, but for legacy software, the task could be entrusted to a different team.


Many organisations will obtain their SBOMs via both routes. After an SBOM has been produced, it must be made available within the organisation. This sometimes requires a processing stage in order to retrieve the relevant information from the supplied SBOM.
Ideally, SBOMs are then made available at a central location for all parties that have to use it. In the case of vulnerability management, this will often be the Security Operations Center (SOC).
Because the software or configuration can be updated, any changes must be recorded in a new SBOM. Ensuring that each version of the software and the configuration has the appropriate SBOM is therefore an important aspect of integrating SBOMs in the organisation. 
If the organisation supplies software to third parties, the relevant SBOMs must also be shared with those
parties. 
Here too, a processing stage may be necessary to determine which information needs to be shared with which parties.

To effectively deploy SBOMs for vulnerability management, the recommendation is to integrate this use with already existing processes as far as possible. In these processes, SBOM will above all be useful in more quickly creating overview and insight. This information can then be used in making risk assessments and arriving at mitigating measures.

## SBOM roles
Because SBOM affects so many aspects of an organisation, different departments and roles within the organisation will be involved in the production or use of an SBOM [2 ]. Departments such as purchasing, contract management and legal will often be responsible for reaching agreements with external parties regarding the receipt and delivery of SBOMs. Departments such as IT management and development will play a driving role in generating SBOMs and keeping them up to date, while the security teams will be the most important users when it comes to deploying SBOMs for vulnerability management. Agreeing on the parameters for successfully matching up these processes is essential. It is therefore advisable to reach clear agreements on how and when the various teams will be involved, for example using RACI tables.
